Modfwango
=========

Modfwango is a modular IRC bot framework written in PHP.  This framework has been refined over the past two years for personal use, and I have just recently decided to make it open to the public.  This IRC bot framework has been used by me almost every day for the past couple of years.  It is stable, clean, modular, and object oriented.


Install
=======

This bot was tested under Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X.  Windows compatibility is unknown, and probabl unstable.  To use this framework, make sure that you have the latest version of PHP 5 CLI installed on your machine.  Configuration for this bot is inside `main.php`.  After you are done configuring the bot, just run the main file with `php main.php` and the bot will start.  You can put this into a screen just by doing `screen php main.php`.


Support
=======

For support with this bot's framework, join our IRC channel at `irc.tinycrab.net` port `6667` channel `#modfwango`.
